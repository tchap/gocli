# About gocli

gocli is yet another package to aid with parsing command line arguments.

Unlike many other libraries, it focuses purely on the support of subcommands.
The rest, mainly the command flags, is handled by recursive chaining of FlagSets.

The help output format is influenced by codegangsta's cli library.

# Status

This is very much still in development, although already quite usable.
